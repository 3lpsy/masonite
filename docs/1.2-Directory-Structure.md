The directory structure is very different than previous python frameworks and works to be more similar to the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/structure) framework.

## The `app/` Directory

This directory contains most of the daily application logic. Under the direct directory root contains all the models. Any file like `app/Books.py` should be a model.

### `app/http`

This directory contains your controllers where you will house all of your application logic that is returned from your routes. Controllers will be explained later in the documentation.

### `app/providers`

This contains files which can *extend* functionality of the site and by default homes the `craft` command line commands.

## The `config/` Directory

This directory is used to contain all different types of configuration files and should be thought of as splitting a `settings.py` file into multiple different configuration files for ease of modification and third party packages.

### `config/application.py`

Contains all general application configuration requirements

### `config/auth.py`

Currently not in use. Future documentation will be created as this is used.

### `config/database.py`

Houses all database configurations that are used inside the application itself. This file grabs certain database
information in your `.env` file

### `config/mail.py`

Currently not in use. Future documentation will be created as this is used.

### `config/payment.py`

Contains any third party payment processors that you need. Third part packages can use this file to integrate their billing services. Currently only the `Billable` model uses this configuration file. 

### `config/storage.py`

Contains a dictionary of folder - alias pairs. Place any folder you would like to be accessible inside your templates. SASS settings are also in this file.

## The `databases` Directory

This directory only houses any migrations that you make. There is one migration by default which will create a `users` table.

### `databases/migrations`

Contains any migrations you make. See the `craft` commands: `migration` and `migrate` for more information on creating migrations

## The `bootstrap/` Directory

Will contain all files that bootstrap the application

### The `bootstrap/start.py`

This is the core of the framework and imports things like routes and request instantiation. This is the file where the wsgi server lives.

## The `resources/` Directory

Contains templates and any other resources needed for the project

### `resources/templates`

Any templates that are rendered with a view will be in this directory. All files should be ended with '.html' to the Jinja2 template engine can find it properly.

## The `routes` Directory

Contains both API and normal web routes in the corresponding files

### `routes/api.py`

Should contain all your API specific routes and should generally be separated from normal HTTP routes.

### `routes/web.py`

Contains all your normal HTTP routes that should return a controller

## The `storage/` Directory

The directory to store any application static files and SASS files

### `storage/compile`

This is where any `.sass` or `.scss` files will be compiled into.

### `storage/static`

Place any static files like `js`, `css` or images here to be served by your app.

### `storage/uploads`

Store any user uploads in this directory

## `.env`

Contains all sensitive information your project needs to access. This file should NOT be pushed to version control and is in the .gitignore file by default.

## `wsgi.py` 

This is a critical file and is needed to run wsgi application. This file imports the wsgi server from `bootstrap/start.py` **Do not delete this file**

## `Procfile`

Used to easily push to heroku which is a popular deployment service. `craft deploy` will deploy your app to Heroku. Heroku needs to be installed on your system for this to work. Can be deleted if you do not plan on deploying to Heroku

## `requirements.txt`

Contains all packages needed for this project. `craft install` uses this file for adding project dependencies to your system.
