Static files have always been a hassle with python frameworks, especially Django

Static assets are a cinch with Masonite. 

## Storing Static Assets

All static assets may be stored inside the `storage/static` folder in your project. throw any css or images there you want. You can make separate folders like `storage/static/css` or `storage/static/images` of course.

## Configuring Static Assets

Inside `config/storage.py` you will find a `STATICFILES` dictionary. In the key of the dictionary just put the folder your assets are stored in for the key, and the alias you would like to use in your templates as the key.

There are two folders that are already configured for you: `storage/static` and `storage/upload`. Both locations are aliased with `static/`

To add a new storage location, add new locations and aliases to the `STATICFILES` list

## How to Access Static Files

All aliases will be the root inside your template files. For example an image inside `storage/static/image.png` will be accessed by doing `<img src='/static/image.png'>` by default configurations.
