## Server Requirements

All development has only been tested on Mac. Windows development environments may differ although there are not currently known issues with Windows.

Needed requirements:

- Pip3 needs to be installed
- Python 3.2+.

Optional requirements:

- Heroku (for `craft deploy` commands)

## Installing Masonite

```
    $ pip install masonite-cli
    $ craft new project
    $ cd project
    $ craft install
    $ craft serve
```

### Explanation

This will create a new project under a folder called `project`. Masonite comes with several dependencies that need to be installed as well. These dependencies can be installed simply with the `craft` command line helper. Just run:

    $ craft install

{alert} You may have to use sudo if you are using a UNIX system

This command will install all needed packages that are in `requirements.txt` file as well as copy .env-example to .env. 

Once that is finished you can serve the development server by running another `craft` command:

    $ craft serve

Open up `127.0.0.1:8000/` and you should see a Masonite welcome screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully setup Masonite. Now Get Crafting!
