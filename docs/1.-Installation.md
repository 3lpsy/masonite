## Server Requirements

All development has only been tested on Mac. Windows development environments may differ although there are not currently known issues with Windows.

Needed requirements:

- Pip3 needs to be installed
- Python 3.3+.

Optional requirements:

- Heroku (for `python craft deploy` command)

## Installing Larapy

Currently the only way to install is via a git clone of this repository. Just simple run the command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/josephmancuso/python-framework.git

This will download the contents of the repository under a folder called `python-framework`. The frameworks comes with several dependencies that needs to be installed as well. These dependencies can be installed simply with the `craft` command line helper. Just run:

    $ python craft install

**NOTE: You may have to use sudo if you are using a UNIX system**

This command will install all needed packages that are in `requirements.txt` file as well as copy .env-example to .env. 

Once that is finished you can serve the development server by running another `craft` command:

    $ python craft serve

Open up `localhost:8000/` and you should see a Larapy welcome screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully setup Larapy
