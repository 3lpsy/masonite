## Become apart of the crafting movement!

Masonite is an exciting new framework which bases a lot of its workflow off of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework and tries to be an all inclusive framework as well. Masonite includes features like

- A similar manual migration system
- Stripe support out of the box
- Get up and going with charging users with stripe within 5 - 10 minutes
- Easily extend user models and create Billable users with official packages. Similar to Laravel's Cashier system.
- A command like tool called `craft` which is similar to `artisan` commands. You can do many helper functions by simply calling `python craft` commands from the terminal. 
- Models that can easily be extended or upgrades and are extremely loosely coupled from the framework unlike Django user models.
- A built in API system where you can simply add models to a route and create full CRUD operations in seconds.

Much much more will be coming to the framework. We will remain in Beta until the framework has enough contributor support and we all feel like it should be pushed to `alpha` or `v1`
