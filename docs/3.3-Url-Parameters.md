Fetching URL parameters from the given route is extremely important in making a framework that can support dynamic content.

## Creating a Route

When creating a route inside `web.py`:

```python
# matches /profile/Joseph/Mancuso
# matches /profile/1/2
Get().route('/profile/@firstname/@lastname')
```

On the backend, this will build a regex. It will default to `(\w+)`. More information on how it actually converts to regex can be found inside `masonite.routes` function in the `fetch()` method

You may also want to specify if the given route is an integer or a string as well. This is simple by passing `:int` or `:string` to the end of the variable inside the route.

For example:

```python
# matches /profile/Joseph/1
# does not match /profile/Joseph/Mancuso
Get().route('/profile/@firstname:string/@id:int')
```

Building URL's is that simple. There will be future support for `:slug`, `:char` etc to add capabilities to the routing system.

## Retrieving URL Parameters

The parameters on the backend are built into a dictionary with the `@variable` as the key and the actual url value as the dictionary value.

So a url like `/profile/@firstname:string/@lastname:string` will build a dictionary like `{'firstname': 'Joseph', 'lastname': 'Mancuso'}`

This data is stored in the `Request` object that is built in the backend and is what is passed as a `request` inside the controller methods `request` parameter.

URL parameters can be retrieved with the `request.param('variable')` method which may look something like:

```python
# url is /profile/@firstname/@lastname:string
def show(self, request):
    print(request.param('firstname')) 
    # prints 'Joseph'
```
