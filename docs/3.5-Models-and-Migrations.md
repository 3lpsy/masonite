All models should be created in the same place which is the root of the `app` directory. Models can be created manually by creating a `.py` file with the model name inside the `app/` directory or can be created using the `craft` tool. Models are a great way to control all your database accession and storage operations and keeps a good separation of concerns with your data.

### Getting Started

There is 1 migration already setup for your project by default which is a migration for a `users` table

One migration creates a migrations table which will keep track of all your migrations and allow you to roll back if needed. 

The second migration sets up a users table with a name, password and email. Both of these migrations have the corresponding model.

{alert} Masonite does not have support for automatic migrations on purpose. There is too much finger crossing with automatic migrations and debugging. Rebuilding migrations once broken takes more time than it saves in the long run. If you want to make changes to your model after you have migrated then you will need to either drop the table and remigrate or run a `craft migration` to alter your model and manually add the fields to the model

### Creating a Model

A model can be created really easily by running the `craft` command

    $ craft model ModelName

This will create a model under `app/ModelName.py` and scaffold out all the imports you need as well as get your model setup with a commented out field.

Masonite models use the Orator ORM system which is an active record type ORM system. Orator documentation can be found [here](https://orator-orm.com/)

### Creating Migrations

The best way to create a migration is through the `craft` command:

    $ craft migration migration_name_goes_here --table users

You can specify the table you want to alter by using the `--table` option. If you are creating a new migration then run the `--create` option. An example of using the `--create` option.

    $ craft migration migration_name_goes_here --create users

This will create a migration under `databases/migrations` and add a record to the `migrations` table. The migrations table is maintained by the framework and does not need to be created or referenced. Open up this migration and add the alter operations inside the `up()` function. A list of possible migration action can be found [here](https://orator-orm.com/docs/0.9/schema_builder.html#adding-columns)

### Migrating

Finally after you have added all the schema operation, in order to create the actual migrations so the database can be updated. Just run:

    $ craft migrate

This will run all the migrations that have not been run yet.
